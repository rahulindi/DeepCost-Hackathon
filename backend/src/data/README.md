# Data Directory

This directory contains runtime data files that are generated by the application.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Files in this directory are NOT committed to git

All files in this directory (except this README) are ignored by git because they may contain:
- User credentials (encrypted)
- AWS credentials
- Authentication tokens
- Cost data cache
- Export job files
- Data lake connection configs

## Files that will be created at runtime:
- `users.json` - User accounts (auto-created)
- `tokens.json` - Refresh tokens (auto-created)
- `aws-credentials.json` - Encrypted AWS credentials
- `email_verification_tokens.json` - Email verification tokens
- `manual-cost-data-*.json` - Cached cost data
- `ri-analysis-*.json` - Reserved instance analysis cache

## For deployment:
These files are created automatically when the application runs.
No manual setup is required.
